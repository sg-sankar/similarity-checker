# Sentence Similarity Checker

This is a simple and intuitive web app that compares the similarity between two sentences using **TF-IDF** vectorization and **cosine similarity**. It is built with **Python**, **scikit-learn**, and **Streamlit**, making it easy to use for non-technical users.

## 🔍 What It Does

The app allows users to input any two sentences and returns a **cosine similarity score** between them — a value between `0` and `1` where:
- `1` means the sentences are identical
- `0` means they are completely different
